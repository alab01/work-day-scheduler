# work-day-scheduler

## The purpose of this project was to create a calender app that helps users note and save their daily tasks for each hour of the work day. Moment.js was used to display the current day in the header and also to update each hour of the tasks. The user can input each task that needs to be noted or completed for each hour of the work day and then save it by clicking the blue save button on the third row. When saved the task is stored in local storage. Each task that has past that given hour will be in grey color, the present hour will be in red and the future hours will be dispalyed in green. 

## Technologies Used: html, css, and java script
